# NoBoredom (ATM 9)
A modified modlist of ATM 9 to include more features

Changes from ATM 9:
- Ad Astra addons
- ISS (Iron's Spells & Spellbooks) addons
- Relics + addons (overriding Artifacts)
- Alex's Mobs + Caves

Installation:
1. Download the modpack (ONLY MODS ARE INCLUDED) from the release tab
2. Download ATM 9 if you haven't already
3. Import the modpack into your launcher
4. Copy over all of the ATM 9 files into the NoBoredom folder EXCEPT "mods"

Actual mod files are not included because every mod has its own policy for uploading it to third-party websites. Everything else from ATM (quests, etc.) is not included either because it is made by the ATM team, and I want to respect everybody's work.
